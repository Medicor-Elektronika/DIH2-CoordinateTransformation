# MediSCARA Robotic Transformation Calculator (MRTC)
This easy-to-use Python program allows 3D coordinate transformations for robotic manufacturing of incubator canopies.

The software was codeveloped with HSMa.

## Setup
No setup operation is needed, just open a console on a PC with the requirements preinstalled and run the following:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Inputs and outputs
As input the program GUI only needs translation and orientation of the pneumatic gripper with the gripper width and the fixed laser translational point with focus length. Given the input coordinates, the program calculates the coordinates and orientation of all 7 sides of the canopy, which can then be used for the industrial robotâ€™s gripper control points.
